      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm a Data Scientist based in Nottingham, UK. I am currently employed as a Data Scientist in the UK Civil Service and produce articles for TowardsDataScience as a Writer, while also studying part-time for an MSc in Data Science. This page is a place for me to showcase some of my personal projects and analysis!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>I am also looking to start offering Data Science services to small businesses, ranging from adhoc production of business reports to fully automated bespoke analytical web apps. If you are working in a small business and want to chat about Data Science, drop me an email! If you're not sure, check out some of my projects and articles below to see if anything interests you!</p>
      <p>I am also happy to consider voluntary work for any local charities who need assistance with anything data-related.</p>
